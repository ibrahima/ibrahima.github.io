[https://github.com/leoliu/ggtags](ggtags) is an Emacs package for
using GNU global. After indexing your project, you can use this
package to jump to the definition or references of a tag (for
instance, a variable name). IDEs have similar features, and this is
one way to get "find usages" or "find definition" functionality in
Emacs.

I don't know how it compares to other methods (eg. ctags and the like)
but from the README it appears to be more advanced, and it's more
actively maintained.
