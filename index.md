        <p class="mbm">I'm a second year PhD student in the <a href="http://ece.ucsd.edu">ECE department</a> at UCSD, majoring in Intelligent Systems. I work in <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~trosing/">Professor Tajana Rosing's</a> <a href="http://seelab.ucsd.edu/">System Energy Efficiency Lab</a>, focusing on workload characterization for mobile devices and the internet of things. I am generally interested in applying machine learning to challenging engineering problems. In my undergraduate career I worked in <a href="http://cs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/">Pieter Abbeel's</a> Robot Learning Lab.

        <p class="mbm">I'm passionate about education, both learning as well as teaching. I have studied a broad variety of topics under the umbrellas of electrical engineering and computer science. I also taught the introductory signal processing (EE20) and circuits (EE40) courses at Berkeley. I was fortunate enough to work on the <a href="https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/commits?author=ibrahima">initial development</a> of the <a href="https://www.edx.org">EdX</a> discussion forums for its launch in fall 2012.</p>
        <p>Along with my colleagues, I developed <a href="https://gradescope.com">Gradescope</a>, a system for facilitating electronic grading of handwritten assignments. Gradescope has been used by hundreds of courses at Berkeley and other institutions, to universally positive reviews from instructors and students alike. I strongly believe in the power of technology to improve the accessibility and quality of education, whether in the context of online education or local instruction.</p>

    <p>I enjoy exploring the beauty of nature, and capturing it with photography. I've also recently picked up distance running, though I'm far from a marathon runner (maybe someday!). Currently I'm aiming to run a half marathon in summer 2015.</p>

        <p>I do some hobbyist web development on the side. Web technologies these days have a very low barrier to entry, which makes it easy to pick up and do something interesting in a short span of time. And the evolution in this space is rapid so there's always something new to learn!</p>
